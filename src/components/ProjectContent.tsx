No need for calculators or tab-switching. Just real-time crypto pricing, baked right into your shopping flow.

	'santa-maria-ios': `📱 Santa Maria – Mobile App (iOS/iPadOS)
🩺 Personalized Health Dashboard for Patients
Built with Flutter · iOS Exclusive · For Santa Maria Clinics

🚀 About the Project
The iOS client app was developed as a companion to the Santa Maria Health Dashboard — providing patients with secure, real-time access to their medical journey, directly from their mobile devices.

This wasn't just an app — it was an extension of the clinic's digital infrastructure, focused on usability, clarity, and smooth communication between patients and healthcare providers.

🔥 The Problem
Many clinics use outdated or fragmented systems that leave patients in the dark about their appointments, procedures, or lab results.
The goal was to bring clarity, trust, and usability to the patient experience — on modern Apple devices.

🛠️ The Solution

📅 Full booking system: view, manage, and cancel appointments

🧪 Access to lab results and medical history

🕓 See upcoming procedures in a clean, structured timeline

🧾 Invoice & billing overview

🔐 Secure authentication and data handling (Firebase)

	'cheqly-life': `✅ Cheqly Life — Project Details
📊 Visual Goal Tracker for Normal People™
Web App · Beta Mode · Built for personal use, open to the world

🚀 About the Project
Cheqly is a minimal but powerful system for daily goal tracking, inspired by the idea that self-awareness beats motivation — especially when you're just trying to survive modern life.

It's not a habit app. It's not a bullet journal.
It's a spreadsheet you don't hate to look at.

🔥 The Problem
You write your goals. You forget them. Rinse and repeat.
Traditional to-do apps don't help when the real challenge is staying aware of your long-term progress — or noticing that you've ghosted your health column for three weeks straight.

🛠️ The Solution

A grid of life categories (health, work, etc.) × time (day/week/month)

✅ Green = did something

⚪️ White = nothing happened

❌ Red = something went wrong

Auto-aggregation from daily → weekly → monthly

Weekly/monthly review mode to spot patterns and course-correct

Focused on visual feedback, not nagging

	'crypto-access-bot': `🔐 Level UP — Crypto Access Bot for Telegram
💸 Subscription Bot for a Private Crypto Community

🚀 About the Project
A custom Telegram bot built for a private crypto community (under NDA) to automate subscription sales and access management.

Supports multi-chain payments, tracks transaction hashes, and grants gated channel access — all with a sleek admin dashboard.

Designed to replace manual verification and streamline paid membership onboarding.

🔥 The Problem
Managing crypto community memberships is usually chaotic:
• Manual transaction checks
• No unified access control
• Limited payment options across blockchains

The client needed a way to automate everything — without sacrificing flexibility or control.

• Users submit a transaction hash — bot verifies it via block explorer APIs
• Successful payment = instant access to the private group
• Admin dashboard for managing members, plans, and analytics
• Built-in refund & ban controls
• Automatic role revocation after expiration

📈 Tech Stack
• Node.js for backend logic
• MongoDB for transactional and user data
• Next.js for admin UI

	'offgrid-diary': `🔒 Offgrid Diary — Encrypted Offline Journal with AI
📱 A Paper-Like Mobile Diary That Works on Airplane Mode

🚀 About the Project
Offgrid Diary is a mobile journaling app built for complete privacy and offline functionality. No cloud sync, no accounts, no data collection — just you, your thoughts, and military-grade encryption.

Built in 5 days of intense vibe-coding with Cursor AI and Claude, this app proves that sometimes the best solutions come from scratching your own itch.

🔥 The Problem
Every journaling app I tried wanted an account, pushed my words to the cloud, or felt bloated.
I wanted a paper-like diary that works on airplane mode and locks itself like a vault.

🛠️ The Solution
• 6-digit PIN screen with AES-256 encrypted storage
• "Time-warp" swipe feature to see entries from this date in previous years
• Subtle ink-ripple animation while typing for a natural writing feel
• Offline AI summaries using LLaMA-7B model (700MB, but worth it)
• Σ-button for AI-powered insights and summaries
• No accounts, no cloud, no tracking

📈 Tech Stack
• Expo (bare workflow) for React Native development
• AES-256 encryption for local data security
• llama.rn for offline AI model integration
• AsyncStorage for encrypted local persistence
• TypeScript for type safety
• Custom animations and UI polish

✨ Key Features
🔐 Military-grade AES-256 encryption
✈️ 100% offline functionality
📅 Time-warp feature for historical entries
🤖 Offline AI summaries and insights
✍️ Natural ink-ripple typing animation
🔢 6-digit PIN security
🎨 Clean, paper-like interface

🔮 The 5-Day Build Log

Day 1 — Vibe-coding sprint (≈ 5h)
Stack: Expo (bare) + Cursor AI + Claude in "pair-programmer" mode
✅ 6-digit PIN screen
✅ AES-256 encrypted storage
✅ Time-warp swipe feature
✅ Subtle ink-ripple animation
✅ [Live-tweeted every commit](https://x.com/MaxBasev/status/1945062786888794341)

Day 2 — The AI rabbit hole
Asked ChatGPT if true offline AI was possible
✅ Added LLaMA-7B Q4 model (~700 MB)
✅ Hooked up llama.rn for offline intelligence
✅ Bought offgriddiary.app domain
✅ Built Vercel landing page with email collection

Day 3 — App Store review drama
❌ Reviewer flagged "AI" and thought I was selling upgrades outside IAP
✅ Explained everything is free for now, future Pro will use Apple IAP
✅ Got the approval ✓

Day 4 — Production bug facepalm
✅ TestFlight worked perfectly
❌ Live build model download failed 🤦‍♂️
✅ Hot-fixed the loader, resubmitted

Day 5 — Live! (kinda)
✅ Version 1.0 live on App Store
🔧 AI summaries work but still quirky
✅ Core experience (offline, encrypted, minimal) is solid

🧪 Behind the Scenes
• Cursor + Claude wrote 80% of the code — I just fixed edge cases
• Ship first, clarify later philosophy
• Users care more about offline & private than fancy cloud sync
• Vibe-coding is legit when you have the right AI pair-programmer

🔮 What's Next
• Tune or replace the 700MB model (TinyLlama maybe)
• Flip the switch on Pro subscription or one-time purchase
• More AI insights and writing prompts

	'critical-mass': `⚠️ Critical Mass — Keep Moving or Your Guns Go Quiet

🚀 About the Project
A fast browser horde survival game built for Vibe Jam 2026.

Your weapon runs on momentum.
Keep moving, keep pressure up, and try not to get swallowed by the swarm.

Built as an AI-assisted game project with Phaser, procedural systems, generated assets, and a slightly unhealthy amount of iteration.

🔥 The Problem
A lot of horde survival games treat movement as positioning only.

You kite, circle, optimize routes, and slowly become a lawn mower with legs.

I wanted something more aggressive: a game where movement itself is the weapon system.
If you slow down, your fire rate drops. If you stop, pressure bleeds off and the horde catches up.

🛠️ The Solution
Critical Mass turns momentum into a core combat mechanic.

- Move to build pressure
- Pressure increases fire rate
- Slow down and your weapon goes quiet
- Survive long enough to stack upgrades and hold the zone

The result is a browser survival game that feels familiar at first, but quickly becomes more about controlled aggression than passive kiting.

✨ Key Features
⚡ Pressure-based combat system
👾 Multiple enemy archetypes, including runners and ranged suppressors
☢️ CASCADE EVENT boss encounter
🔫 Combat modifiers like Lance Round and Twin Emitter
🎵 Dynamic music with smooth transitions
🌐 Instant-play browser build with no login or install
🤖 AI-assisted production workflow

📈 Tech Stack
Built with Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Vite

- Phaser 3 for gameplay, animation, camera, and combat systems
- TypeScript in strict mode
- Vite for fast iteration and static deployment
- Web Audio + generated / curated assets
- Sprite, effect, and UI pipeline assembled with AI-assisted workflow

🧠 Production Workflow
This project was built with heavy AI collaboration:

- ChatGPT — design direction, gameplay planning, naming, iteration guidance
- Claude — implementation and code generation
- Gemini — sprite and visual asset generation

The jam rule was 90%+ AI-written code, so instead of hiding that, I leaned into it and treated the whole game as an experiment in directed AI-assisted game production.

🎮 Design Philosophy
Movement should matter more than comfort
Pressure should be a mechanic, not a flavor word
Short runs, fast feedback, no dead air
Readable chaos > fake complexity
A strong vertical slice beats a bloated feature list

🔮 What's Next
More enemy/event variety
Extra combat modifier branches
More environmental identity in the arena
Further polish for feel, UI, and presentation
Possible post-jam expansion as a portfolio-quality vertical slice
